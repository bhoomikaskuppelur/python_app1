## 🛠️ Applications Included

### 1. 🔑 Strong Password Generator (`password_generator.py`)
A Tkinter GUI application that creates personalized, highly secure 16-character passwords based on the user's username.

#### **Features**
- **Personalized Complexity**: Integrates sanitized portions of the username while ensuring random uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols (`!@#$%^&*()-_=+?`).
- **One-Click Clipboard Copy**: Instantly copy the generated password to your clipboard.
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist visual layout built with native Python Tkinter styling[cite: 2, 4].

A command-line interface (CLI) quiz application that dynamically loads multiple-choice questions from an external JSON file and provides a detailed post-game report card.

#### **Features**
- **Dynamic Question Loading**: Fetches questions, options, and correct answers directly from `questions.json`.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures valid choice inputs (`A`, `B`, `C`, or `D`).
- **Comprehensive Scorecard**: Outputs a tabular summary detailing selected answers, correct answers, total scores, percentages, and performance ratings[cite: 3, 4].
